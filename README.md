# **Tiger_Force_AR**

**Tiger Force AR** is an **augmented reality (AR) app** that brings to life the intense battle of Company C of the 82nd Battalion, 7th Brigade during the **Yom Kippur War**. The app provides an immersive experience of the **"Tiger's Night Ambush"** in the **Golan Heights**, allowing users to witness the battle in the exact location where it occurred.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Overview**

This app was created as part of my **final year** at **Braude College**, in collaboration with my teammates. The goal was to blend **augmented reality** with **historical storytelling**, providing an engaging way for users to experience the battle firsthand. The project was a significant effort, involving **research**, interviews with **veterans**, and the development of realistic AR simulations.

## üèóÔ∏è **Prototype 3D Model**

As part of the development process, we were introduced to a **prototype 3D model** of the **Golan Heights** and the **tank positions**. This model played a crucial role in understanding the **spatial arrangement** of the battlefield and ensuring the **accuracy** of our AR simulation.

- The **prototype model** helped us visualize how the **tanks** should fit within the real-world environment.
- It was a key reference for placing the **AR markers** accurately on the ground.
- The model also provided insights into the **terrain** and **elevation changes** that would influence how the tanks moved and interacted in the simulation.

Here is an example of the **3D prototype model** that was shown to our team for review:

## ü§ù **Team Collaboration**

This project was a **team effort** during my final year at **Braude College**. Our team worked together to develop the app, which required intensive research and collaboration. The project combined our individual expertise in **Unity**, **AR development**, and **historical research**. 

---

## üéØ **Intended Audience**

This app is designed for:
- **History enthusiasts** interested in the Yom Kippur War.
- **Students** looking to explore the historical significance of the battle through technology.
- **Visitors** to the Golan Heights who want to see a simulation of the battle right where it happened.

---

## üñ±Ô∏è **How to Interact with AR Elements**

- **AR Markers**: The app uses AR markers placed at specific locations. Point your device‚Äôs camera at these markers to trigger the AR experience.
  
- **On-Screen Buttons**: Use buttons within the app to:
  - Toggle between **AR view** and **map view**.
  - Control the **battle simulation** (start/stop the tank battle).

---

## üîß **Building and Running the App**

To build and run the app yourself, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in **Unity** (the project was developed using **Unity** with AR support).

3. Ensure you have **ARCore** installed for Android development. You can check ARCore's compatibility [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover).

4. Build the project for **Android**. You can then either:
   - **Install the APK** manually on your device, or
   - **Build the APK** and install it via Android Studio or Unity.

5. Follow the instructions to install and launch the app on your Android device.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Requirements**

- **Android**: The app is compatible with Android devices that support **ARCore**. (Check if your device is ARCore compatible).
  
- **Permissions**: The app requires access to your device‚Äôs **camera** to render AR elements.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues or Limitations**

- The development process involved **extensive research** and interviews with veterans, which was time-consuming and sometimes challenging. Some aspects of the simulation may not be 100% historically accurate due to limited data availability.
